# S-Prompts Learning with Pre-trained Transformers: An Occam’s Razor for Domain Incremental Learning

<div align="justified">
  This is the official implementation of our NeurIPS 2022 paper "S-Prompts Learning with Pre-trained Transformers: An Occam’s Razor for Domain Incremental Learning".
In this paper, we propose one simple paradigm (named as S-Prompting) and two concrete approaches. The best of the proposed approaches achieves a remarkable relative improvement (an average of about 30%) over the best of the state-of-the-art exemplar-free methods for three standard Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) tasks.

## Introduction

<div align="justified">
S-Prompts introduce a rule-breaking idea to play a win-win game for domain incremental learning.
Specifically, S-Prompts uses a new prompting paradigm that learns the prompts independently domain by domain, and incrementally inserts the learned prompts in a pool.
The learning process only requests the most naive cross-entropy loss for supervision. 
The inference is also simple and efficient. 
It simply uses K-NN to search for the nearest domain center generated by K-Means on the training data to the features of the given test sample, followed by prepending the learned domain-associated prompts with the image tokens to the transformer for the final classification. 
As S domain-related prompts will be finally learned independently, where S is the total number of domains, we name the proposed paradigm as S-Prompts or S-Prompting for simplicity throughout the paper. 
We hope the proposed S-Prompting becomes an Occam’s Razor (i.e., a simple and elegant principle) for DIL.

## Enviroment setup
Create the virtual environment for S-Prompts.
```python
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
After this, you will get a new environment **sp** that can conduct S-Prompts experiments.  
Run `conda activate sp` to activate.

Note that only NVIDIA GPUs are supported for now, and we use NVIDIA RTX 3090.

## Training:

Please change the `data_path` in the config files to the locations of the datasets。  

Currently, there are two options for `net_type` in the config files: `slip` and `sip`.  
`slip` means S-liPrompts and `sip` means S-iPrompts.  

Feel free to change the parameters in the config files, following scripts will reproduce the main results in our paper.

### CDDB:
```
python main.py --config configs/cddb_slip.json
python main.py --config configs/cddb_sip.json
```

### CORe50:
```
python main.py --config configs/core50_slip.json
```

### DomainNet:
```
python main.py --config configs/domainnet_slip.json
```
